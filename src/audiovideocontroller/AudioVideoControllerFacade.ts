   *
   * * `MeetingSessionStatusCode.OK`: The promotion was successful (i.e. session token was valid,
   *   there was room in the Primary meeting, etc.), audio will begin flowing
   *   and the attendee can begin to send data messages, and content/video if the call is not already at limit.

   *   were invalid when connection attempted to Primary meeting. There may be an issue
   *   with your mechanism which allocates the Primary meeting attendee for the Replica
   *   meeting proxied promotion.  This also may indicate that this API was called in a
   *   non-Replica meeting.
   * * `MeetingSessionStatusCode.AudioCallAtCapacity`: Credentials provided were correct
   *   but there was no room in the Primary meeting.  Promotions to Primary meeting attendee take up a slot, just like
   *   regular Primary meeting attendee connections and are limited by the same mechanisms.
   * * `MeetingSessionStatusCode.SignalingBadRequest` or `MeetingSessionStatusCode.SignalingInternalServerError`:
   *   Other failure, possibly due to disconnect or timeout. These failures are likely retryable.
   *
   * Application code may also receive a callback on `AudioVideoObserver.videoAvailabilityDidChange` to indicate they
   * can begin to share video.
   *
   * `chime::DeleteAttendee` on the Primary meeting attendee will result in `AudioVideoObserver.audioVideoWasDemotedFromPrimaryMeeting`
   * to indicate the attendee is no longer able to share.
   *
   * Any disconnection will trigger an automatic demotion to avoid unexpected or unwanted promotion state on reconnection.
   * If the attendee still needs to be an interactive participant in the Primary meeting, `promoteToPrimaryMeeting`
   * should be called again with the same credentials.
   *
   * This function should not be called until the first one resolves.
